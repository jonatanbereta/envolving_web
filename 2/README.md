## Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension. Volar provides enhanced support for Vue 3 and TypeScript.

### Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TypeScript

TypeScript does not natively handle type information for `.vue` imports. By default, they are shimmed to be generic Vue component types. If you need accurate prop types in `.vue` imports, you can enable Volar's Take Over mode by following these steps:

1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VS Code's command palette.
2. Look for `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right-click, and select `Disable (Workspace)`.
3. Reload the VS Code window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

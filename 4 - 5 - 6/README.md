# Question 4 - technical problem or client requirement

My most recent challenge was developing the system for Projaide, here in Montreal. I had to develop a complex system alone to handle a flow of more than 3000 people. 

Despite the technical challenge, the project also involved the challenge of communication in a language, in this case, French, which I am not a native speaker of.

The challenge began when the director of the institution learned that I was a programmer and told me about her situation. She had paid another professional to develop a new system for the organization, and more than a year had passed without delivery.

She then described the difficulties of the very old, precarious, and outdated system they were using, which no longer met the institution's purposes. 

She proposed the challenge of developing this new system in a sustainable, easy-to-maintain, fast, and crash-free manner, accessible by various devices. 

I accepted the challenge and was able to meet the needs of this organization.

This project contributed to my professional growth and allowed me to further develop my communication skills in French and English.

References and details about my work on this project can be discussed with Isabelle Tremblay, director of Projaide, at (438) 391-8506.

# Question 5 - challenging interpersonal

A situation I experienced with a colleague was when a client opened a ticket to resolve an incident in an e-commerce project. This incident prevented the logged-in user from viewing all their completed sales, as the information was static, meaning any user would see the same list of completed sales. 

The client was very upset and demanded urgency. This task was assigned to my colleague of the same level, as he was the developer who had created this feature. 

However, even though he had developed this feature, he was unable to resolve the incident. 

So the leader reassigned this task to me, and upon analysis, I found that my colleague had left the IDs static in the code, which is why no user could access their sales. 

I didn't want to accuse him of the mistake; I felt uncomfortable because I knew our leader would pressure him for the error, and it was I who detected and reported the error. 

In this situation, I prioritized the client's needs, even if my colleague was upset that I reported the problem. 

After everything was resolved, I approached my colleague and had a professional conversation, and he understood the whole context, and we maintained a good relationship.

# Question 6 - able to work during Montreal business hours

I confirm my availability to work in Montreal from 9am to 5pm EST.
